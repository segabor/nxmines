NXMines
=======

## Summary

NXMines is just a plain Minesweeper clone written in Objective-C.

## Background

NXMines was my first app I wrote on NeXTSTEP 3.2 operating system. It was a good exercise to learn the language, the frameworks and the dev toolchain provided by NeXT.

Years gone, APIs changed, NeXT merged with Apple and NXMines followed up all of them. Now it is an OSX app.
